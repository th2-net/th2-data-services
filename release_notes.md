# v0.2.5

## Features

1. [TH2-2248] Make python 3.6 compatibility

## BugFixes

1. [TH2-2232] Lib raises "TypeError" during Data.__del__ execution
2. [TH2-2213] [DataServices]: Intermediate error in th2-rpt-data-provider when unloading events from
   th2-rpt-data-provider.

# v0.3.0

## Improvements

1. Refactor Utils module
2. Changing Data Workflow
3. Tests were added
4. Pre-commit was added

## Features

1. find_messages_by_id_from_data_provider and find_events_by_id_from_data_provider functions returns dict if arg1 == str
   else list. So if your request only one message or event it returns Dict.

2. An experimental EventsTree2 class has been added with a real tree inside.

## BugFixes

1. [TH2-2323] Memory leak when we use Data object.

# v0.3.1

## BugFixes

1. [TH2-2330] Data iterator have been broken in v0.3.0

# v0.4.1

## Improvements

1. [TH2-2322] The lib was separated to 2 parts. New lib with ds_utils posted
   in [here](https://github.com/th2-net/th2-data-services-utils)
2. [TH2-2335] A pipeline was created that sends a packet to PyPi for the branch with the pypi_ prefix.

## BugFixes

1. [TH2-2299] Error and keep_alive status were handled.

# v0.5.0

## User impact and migration instructions

1. [I] You no longer need to enter UTC time corrected for local time. DataSource methods now expect UTC time.  
   [M] Change the time to UTC in all your scripts.
2. [I] The last "messageIds" message in the messages stream will be ignored.  
   [M] If you do checks for the last message, you can delete them.
3. [I] _DataSource.write_to_txt_ was moved to Data. The name has been changed to _write_to_file_.  
   [M] If you use _write_to_file_ function, change the corresponding class and method.
4. [I] _len(Data)_ functionality was removed. The _Data.len_ property is now used.  
   [M] Change _len(Data)_ to _Data.len_ for your functions.
5. [I] The codec-pipeline wrapper-messages are now split into sub-messages.  
   [M] If you use wrapper-messages for your statistics then adapt functions for sub-messages (now they look like a usual
   message)

## Improvements

1. [TH2-2427] Refactoring
    - Reduced waiting time of connection check.
    - The last "messageIds" message in the message stream will be ignored. Lib user will not get it.
    - DataSource.write_to_txt was moved to Data. The name has been changed to write_to_file.
    - Up requirement libs versions.
2. len(Data) functionality was removed because it has side effects when we use list(Data)
   and too expensive to use. **Please use Data.len property instead.**
3. [TH2-2474] Use of cache was revised.
4. [TH2-2553] The time that have given in some method of data_source module now will expect in utc format.
5. [TH2-2601] Unit tests were added in CI.

## Features

1. Added Data.limit(num) method to use in the pipeline.
2. Added Data.write_to_file(filename) due to TH2-2427.
3. Added Data.len property to use instead of len(Data)
4. Added Data.is_empty property
5. [TH-2420] Added adapter for codecs pipeline.
6. [TH2-2575] Added ParentEventsTree class in events tree module.
7. [TH2-2577] Added optional arguments (stub_if_broken_event: bool) in find_events_by_id_from_data_provider method of
   data_source module. If stub_if_broken_event is True and some ids is not available on data provider: method return
   stub inside.

## BugFixes

1. [TH2-2424] Cache function was fixed.
2. [TS-766] Fixed case when Data Services cannot recover more than 64 unknown events.
3. [TH2-2419] find_X_by_id_from_data_provider functions return expected objects

# v0.5.1

## Improvements

1. [TH2-2724] The user can be able to deal with problematic messages.

# v0.5.2

## BugFixes

1. [TH2-2731] Fixed a problem with using map function with list of records.

# v0.5.3

## BugFixes

1. [TH2-2756] Changed adapter for messages from pipeline.
2. Fixed a situation when messages were not opened from the list when we use map more that once.

# v0.6.0

## User impact and migration instructions

1. [I] The "metadataOnly" query parameter will now always be set to False in the get_X_from_data_provider methods. Itâ€™s
   the option for Report Viewer front-end only.  
   [M] (Optional) Remove "metadataOnly" parameter in your requests to get more logical and clean code.

## Improvements

1. [TH2-2471] The "metadataOnly" query parameter will now always be set to False in the get_X_from_data_provider
   methods.

## Features

1. You can import classes directly from th2_data_services now.  
   E.g. `from th2_data_services import Data, DataSource, Filter`
2. [TH2-2755] Added new parameters to DataSource methods.
    1. get_X_from_data_provider:
        - sse_adapter=True. If True, all data will go through SSE adapter and yield dicts. Otherwise adapter will yield
          SSE Events.
    2. get_messages_from_data_provider and find_messages_by_id_from_data_provider:
        - provider_adapter=adapter_provider5. Adapter function for rpt-data-provider. If None, Data object will yield
          object from previous map function.
3. [TH2-2283] Implemented rpt-data-provider Filters API.
4. [TH2-2656] Added new optional parameter to EventsTree (ParentEventsTree) classes.
    - Set "preserve_body=True" to keep event bodies during tree building.
    - Otherwise events bodies will be omitted.

# v0.6.1

## BugFixes

1. [TH2-2858] Resolved HTTP error 414 on a client side.
2. [TH2-2851] UnicodeDecodeError is raised during events extracting if not utf-8 character in the byte stream. User will
   get original byte now.

# v0.6.2

## BugFixes

1. [TH2-2922] Fixed infinite loop in events tree.

# v1.0.0

The main goal of the release 1.0.0 is to implement new architecture that solves many of extension's problems. 
It also allows you to create your own Commands/DataSources/SourceAPIs.

## Attention

The new version has raised the major version. It means the users should update their code to work with the new DS lib.

Version 0.6.x won't have new features but will have bug fixes.

Version 1.x.y doesn't use any adapters by default, 0.6.x does. If you need the save behavior as previous,
use `CodecPipelinesAdapter` manually.

## User impact and migration instructions

1. [I] There is no more old-style DataSource class.  
   [M] Use a specific class for your purposes (HTTPDataSource or GRPCDataSource).
2. [I] There are no more `get_x` methods in the DataSource classes. Instead, it has the command method. This method
   takes an object of the Command class.  
   [M] So if you used `data_source.get_events_from_data_provider` use `data_source.command(GetEvents(ARGS))` instead.  
   from `data_source.get_messages_from_data_provider` to `data_source.command(GetMessages(ARGS).apply_adapter(
   codec_pipeline_adapter))`  
   from `find_messages_by_id_from_data_provider` to `GetMessagesById` or `GetMessageById`  
   from `find_events_by_id_from_data_provider` to `GetEventsById` or `GetEventById`  
   if you used broken_events parameter initialize the command with use_stub=True parameter.
3. [I] Modules structure was changed.  
   [M] You need to change some import paths.
4. [I] All class constructors/methods have got explicit arguments.  
   [M] Change old args names to new if required.
5. [I] Set of classes to create `EventsTree` representation was significantly changed.
   [M] Use `EventsTreesCollection` instead of `EventsTree`. `EventsTree` is a real tree structure now. 
   Note, `EventsTreesCollection` has other methods, see the example to understand how to work with it.
6. [I] `EventsTree2` was removed.  
   [M] Use `EventsTreesCollection` instead.
7. [I] Exceptions were updated.  
   [M] Update your try-except statements

## Improvements

1. [TH2-3247] Move DS version 1.0.0 to python 3.7+
2. [TH2-3404] Exceptions were updated. Implemented library-based exceptions.
3. [TH2-3213] Old `data_source` module was removed.

## Features

1. [TH2-2465] Added the module `th2_gui_report` to create a link by event id or message id.
2. [TH2-2274] rpt-data-provider GRPC interface was implemented.
3. [TH2-3194] New `EventsTree` solution implemented. It includes the best parts from previous trees. 
   The tree also got a lot of useful methods to work with it ([see doc](documentation/api/events_tree.events_tree.md)). 
4. [TH2-2942] Pure Provider v5 APIs implemented: `GRPCProvider5API`, `HTTPProvider5API`.
5. [TH2-2944] Developed commands for http and grpc instead of `data_source` get/find methods.
6. [TH2-2994] Provider v5 data source classes implemented: `GRPCProvider5DataSource`, `HTTPProvider5DataSource`.
7. [TH2-2941] Interface classes implemented:  `ISourceAPI`, `IDataSource`, `ICommand`, `IAdapter`.

## BugFixes

1. [TH2-3168] Fixed iterations in nested loops for Data object with limit.
2. [TH2-3354] API Doc generator issue fixed.
3. [TH2-3216] Incorrect work of Data object with multi-looping with cache enabled fixed.
